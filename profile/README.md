# NeuroConnV UCSF

Our research program aims to understand the neural basis of language and cognitive functions through the application of novel and multimodal brain MRI techniques in a wide range of neurological diseases and conditions.

Our work focus on the development of automated algorithms for white matter tractography, structural and functional imaging processing. These techniques offer a more comprehensive approach to clinical research and have led to clinically relevant discoveries and influential publications in areas highly relevant to our patient populations.
